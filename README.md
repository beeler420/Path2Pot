WORKING WITH STEAM AND STANDALONE

This does read memory; Your Anti-Virus may ring some alarms. If using standard browser with Windows Defender, just go into Defender settings and turn off Real Time Protection to allow the download. 

We us PyMem to read memory, We do not need inject or alter anything else in memory. 


TO USE:
1) Open Game
2) Start exe
3) Adjust sliders for wanted thresholds (IF YOU DONT USE ES AND NO ES POT, SLIDE ES SLIDER TO "0")
4) ENJOY

IF not working leave me a message, more than likely will need pointers and offsets updated.
